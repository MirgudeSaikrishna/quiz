## 📊 Key Metrics & Calculations

### Interest Calculation Formula
```
Monthly Interest Rate = Annual Rate / 12 / 100
Months Elapsed = (Current Date - Start Date) / 30 days
Current Interest = Principal × Monthly Rate × Months Elapsed
Total Amount = Principal + Current Interest
```

### P&L Calculation
```
Income = Sum of all interest earned from loans given
Expenses = Sum of all interest paid on loans taken
Net P&L = Income - Expenses
Profit Margin = (Net P&L / Total Income) × 100
```
